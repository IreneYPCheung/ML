## Machine learning for aiding the diagnostic of pathology on the Vertebral Column
The purpose of study is applying machine learning techniques to characterize Pathologies of the Vertebral Column. By analysing  six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine: (1) pelvic incidence, (2) pelvic tilt,(3) lumbar lordosis angle,(4) sacral slope, (5) pelvic radius and (6) grade of spondylolisthesis, which can be classified of individuals with normal or abnormal Vertebral Column pathology.

One common pathology of the Vertebral Column is spondylolisthesis, it has been associated with the abnormal (i) spino-pelvic morphology, (ii) sacro-pelvic orientation (iii) disturbed global sagittal balance of spine.

Understanding the relationships of these biomechanical characteristics are significantly importance for the discernment of sagittal balance in normal and pathologic (abnormal) conditions of the spine and pelvis.  

In addition, by using Machine Learning Models can help orthopaedist to make diagnostic and treatment planning.  

Eventually, providing early intervention for Individuals with abnormal sagittal balance who are at risk of progressive spinal deformity and pain.

Data Set Information
Biomedical data set built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence period in the Group of Applied Research in Orthopaedics (GARO) of the Centre MÃ©dico-Chirurgical de RÃ©adaptation des Massues, Lyon, France.

Data set containing values for six biomechanical features used to classify orthopaedic patients into 2 classes (normal or abnormal).It consists in classifying patients as belonging to two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients).
